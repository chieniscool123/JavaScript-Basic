  /*
In JavaScript, function expressions (as opposed to function declarations) can be anonymous.
 When you assign a function to a variable, the function doesn't have to have a nameâ€”it can simply be an unnamed function expression. 
 The variable (generateUserGreeting in this case) holds the reference to that function, allowing you to call it by the variable name.
